-- Task 1: Aggregation query to find total bookings per user
-- This query uses COUNT function and GROUP BY to aggregate booking data by user

SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.role,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM User u
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email, u.role
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC, u.first_name ASC;

-- Task 2: Window function to rank properties by total bookings
-- This query uses ROW_NUMBER() and RANK() window functions to rank properties

SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS row_number_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS rank_position
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
