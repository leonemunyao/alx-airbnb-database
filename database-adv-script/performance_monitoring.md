# Database Performance Monitoring and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of database performance for the Airbnb database, including query execution plan analysis, bottleneck identification, and optimization recommendations with implementation results.

## Monitoring Methodology

### 1. Performance Profiling Setup
Before monitoring, we enabled query profiling and configured performance monitoring:

```sql
-- Enable query profiling
SET profiling = 1;
SET profiling_history_size = 100;

-- Enable slow query log for detailed analysis
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 0.1; -- Log queries taking more than 0.1 seconds
```

### 2. Performance Schema Configuration
```sql
-- Enable performance schema events
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments 
SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES' 
WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%';

UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers 
SET ENABLED = 'YES' 
WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%';
```

## Frequently Used Queries Analysis

### Query 1: Property Search with Filters
**Description**: Search for available properties with location and amenity filters
**Frequency**: High (used in main search functionality)

```sql
-- Original Query
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
FROM Property p
JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location LIKE '%New York%'
AND p.pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, p.pricepernight ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Performance Analysis using EXPLAIN ANALYZE**:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
FROM Property p
JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location LIKE '%New York%'
AND p.pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, p.pricepernight ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Bottlenecks Identified**:
1. **Full table scan on Property table** - No index on location column
2. **Inefficient LIKE operation** - Using wildcard at beginning
3. **No index on pricepernight** - Range queries are slow
4. **Expensive GROUP BY operation** - Multiple columns in GROUP BY
5. **Sorting overhead** - No supporting indexes for ORDER BY

### Query 2: User Booking History
**Description**: Retrieve complete booking history for a user
**Frequency**: Medium (user profile and history pages)

```sql
-- Original Query
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    p.name as property_name,
    p.location,
    u.first_name as host_name
FROM Booking b
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
WHERE b.user_id = 'user123'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

**Performance Analysis**:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    p.name as property_name,
    p.location,
    u.first_name as host_name
FROM Booking b
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
WHERE b.user_id = 'user123'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

**Bottlenecks Identified**:
1. **Missing index on Booking.user_id** - Sequential scan required
2. **No index supporting ORDER BY** - Expensive sorting operation
3. **Multiple JOIN operations** - Could benefit from denormalization

### Query 3: Property Availability Check
**Description**: Check if properties are available for specific date ranges
**Frequency**: Very High (booking system core functionality)

```sql
-- Original Query
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
FROM Property p
WHERE p.property_id NOT IN (
    SELECT b.property_id
    FROM Booking b
    WHERE b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending')
    AND (
        (b.start_date <= '2025-08-01' AND b.end_date >= '2025-08-01')
        OR (b.start_date <= '2025-08-15' AND b.end_date >= '2025-08-15')
        OR (b.start_date >= '2025-08-01' AND b.end_date <= '2025-08-15')
    )
)
AND p.location LIKE '%Miami%';
```

**Performance Analysis**:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
FROM Property p
WHERE p.property_id NOT IN (
    SELECT b.property_id
    FROM Booking b
    WHERE b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending')
    AND (
        (b.start_date <= '2025-08-01' AND b.end_date >= '2025-08-01')
        OR (b.start_date <= '2025-08-15' AND b.end_date >= '2025-08-15')
        OR (b.start_date >= '2025-08-01' AND b.end_date <= '2025-08-15')
    )
)
AND p.location LIKE '%Miami%';
```

**Bottlenecks Identified**:
1. **Inefficient NOT IN subquery** - Can be NULL-unsafe and slow
2. **Complex date range logic** - Multiple OR conditions
3. **No composite indexes** - Date range queries need optimization
4. **Missing status index** - Status filtering is slow

## Performance Metrics Before Optimization

### Query Execution Time Analysis
```sql
-- Show query profile for recent queries
SHOW PROFILES;

-- Detailed profile for specific query
SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY [query_id];
```

### Performance Schema Analysis
```sql
-- Top 10 slowest queries
SELECT 
    DIGEST_TEXT,
    COUNT_STAR,
    AVG_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000 as avg_exec_time_sec,
    MAX_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000 as max_exec_time_sec,
    SUM_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000 as total_exec_time_sec
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY avg_exec_time_sec DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Index Usage Analysis
```sql
-- Check index usage statistics
SELECT 
    OBJECT_SCHEMA,
    OBJECT_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME,
    COUNT_FETCH,
    COUNT_INSERT,
    COUNT_UPDATE,
    COUNT_DELETE
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE OBJECT_SCHEMA = 'airbnb_db'
ORDER BY COUNT_FETCH DESC;
```

## Optimization Implementations

### 1. Index Optimizations

#### A. Property Search Optimization
```sql
-- Create composite index for location and price filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_price ON Property(location, pricepernight);

-- Create index for location prefix searches
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_prefix ON Property(location(20));

-- Create index for host lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_property_host ON Property(host_id);
```

#### B. Booking Query Optimization
```sql
-- Create composite index for user bookings with date sorting
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_date ON Booking(user_id, start_date DESC);

-- Create composite index for availability queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_availability ON Booking(property_id, status, start_date, end_date);

-- Create index for date range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_date_range ON Booking(start_date, end_date);
```

#### C. Review Performance Enhancement
```sql
-- Create index for property ratings
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_rating ON Review(property_id, rating);

-- Create index for review queries
CREATE INDEX idx_review_user_property ON Review(user_id, property_id);
```

### 2. Query Rewriting

#### A. Property Search Query Optimization
```sql
-- Optimized query with better structure
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    COALESCE(r.avg_rating, 0) as avg_rating
FROM Property p
JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT property_id, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
    FROM Review
    GROUP BY property_id
) r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location LIKE 'New York%'  -- Removed leading wildcard
AND p.pricepernight BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, p.pricepernight ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### B. Availability Check Query Optimization
```sql
-- Rewritten with EXISTS instead of NOT IN
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
FROM Property p
WHERE p.location LIKE 'Miami%'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Booking b
    WHERE b.property_id = p.property_id
    AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending')
    AND b.start_date <= '2025-08-15'
    AND b.end_date >= '2025-08-01'
);
```

### 3. Schema Optimizations

#### A. Denormalization for Performance
```sql
-- Add frequently accessed columns to reduce JOINs
ALTER TABLE Booking ADD COLUMN property_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE Booking ADD COLUMN host_name VARCHAR(255);

-- Create trigger to maintain denormalized data
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER booking_denorm_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Booking
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Booking b
    JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
    JOIN User u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
    SET b.property_name = p.name,
        b.host_name = CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name)
    WHERE b.booking_id = NEW.booking_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

#### B. Partitioning Implementation
```sql
-- Implement partitioning for large tables (already implemented in partitioning.sql)
-- This helps with query performance and maintenance
```
