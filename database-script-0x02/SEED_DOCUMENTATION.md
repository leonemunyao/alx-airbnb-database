# Seed Data Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the sample data inserted into the Airbnb database through the `seed.sql` file. The seed data creates a realistic scenario with users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages to demonstrate the database functionality.

## Overview

The seed data populates six main tables with interconnected sample records that simulate real-world usage of an Airbnb-like platform. The data includes three users with different roles, two properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages between users.

## Table Data Breakdown

### üîê User Table

The User table contains three sample users representing different roles in the system:

## Data Relationships

The seed data demonstrates key relationships in the database:

1. **User-Property Relationship**: Jude (host) owns both properties
2. **User-Booking Relationship**: Gabriel (guest) makes both bookings
3. **Property-Booking Relationship**: Each property has associated bookings
4. **Booking-Payment Relationship**: Each booking has a corresponding payment
5. **Property-Review Relationship**: Both properties have reviews from the guest
6. **User-Message Relationship**: Users communicate through the messaging system

## Business Logic Demonstrated

The seed data showcases several important business scenarios:

- **Multi-property hosts**: One host managing multiple properties
- **Repeat customers**: One guest booking multiple properties
- **Different booking statuses**: Confirmed vs. pending bookings
- **Multiple payment methods**: Credit card and mobile payments
- **Review system**: Guest feedback on properties
- **Communication**: Host-guest messaging for inquiries

## Data Integrity Notes

- All foreign key relationships are properly maintained
- Monetary amounts are consistent between bookings and payments
- Timestamps use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for realistic date/time values
- User roles are diverse (guest, host, admin) for comprehensive testing
- Phone numbers include NULL values to test optional field handling

This seed data provides a solid foundation for testing the Airbnb database system with realistic, interconnected records that demonstrate the platform's core functionality.
